 JnS.c			C implementation of JADE and SHIBBS including
			code for joint diagonalization

 Gateway.c		These three files provide a Matlab interface
 JadeR.c		to the C implementations of
 ShibbsR.c		JADE and SHIBBS

 JointDiag.c		A Matlab interface to the joint-diag C code
			in JnS.c

 MatlabjadeR.m		Matlab implementation of JADE
 MatlabshibbsR.m	Matlab implementation of SHIBBS

 Matutil.c		Matrix utilities, no longer useful but...

 testJnS.c 		A short C program for testing Jade and Shibbs
 testJnS.m 		A short Matalb program for testing Jade and Shibbs
			and comparing Matalb and C versions
 testJointDiag.m	A short Matlab program for testing the C version
			of the joint diagonalization code.


 Makefile		limited facility for building things


================================================================
Usage:

o Compile everything necesary by `make all'

o Build the Mex-files by `make mex' or by

	 > mex ShibbsR.c 
	 > mex JadeR.c
	 > mex JointDiag.c

o Check code under Matlab by running the various test programs
  or a more limited check with C using testJnC.c


================================================================
Notes:

o The usage of JADE is documented in the Matlab source

o The C implementations do not do the projection onto the `signal
  subspace' yet : one cannot only ask for as many `sources as
  sensors'.

o It is not necessary to have Matlab available to compile and run the
  C code.  IOW, JADE can be used as a stand alone.  BUT, you may have
  to comment out the relevant parts in the Make files and elsewhere/
